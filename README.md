# Airline-Customers-Satisfaction


This project aims to analyze airline customer satisfaction data of the flights in the United States of America and provide actionable insights that will enable them to improve satisfaction. Since the economics of the industry is majorly dependent on customer satisfaction, it is essential to get insights into factors affecting it. The dataset provided is huge around 130,000 rows and 28 variables. The Customer Ratings are on the scale 0-5. The Data is from 14 different airlines flying in the USA. Finding the significant factors that affect the rating and how do they do it is the primary question which leads to other subqueries.

The general approach followed through this Project is: Brainstorming for the pertinent data questions. Cleaning the data for irregularities and replacing missing information Identifying a set of relevant variables Finding relation between variables and to the satisfaction rating Creating prediction models to show performance of these variables Validating performance among different models Providing actionable insights after the analysis
